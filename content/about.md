I often describe myself as a passionate Software Engineer who derives satisfaction from delivering value just as much as I appreciate crafting code that is both skillfully designed and efficient. However, I also possess the discernment to recognize when each aspect deserves greater focus


The initial purpose of this blog was to share knowledge, but over time, it has become a way for me to create and retain knowledge that I find interesting or that I may need in the future. So, in advance, I apologize if the content is not easily understood. In general, this blog was made for my future self


The posts can be either in Portuguese or in English, depending on my mood
